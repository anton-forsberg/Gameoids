# Don't Look Down
Developed in Unity
## Instructions
* Move using WASD, look around with the mouse
* Jump using space
* In various ways, create three different types of fields: 
  * Blue: Anti-grativy. Launches you upwards allowing you to ascend to higher platforms.
  * Yellow: High-gravity. Makes you heavy which causes you to fall quickly, allowing fast descent to lower platforms.
  * Green: Speed. Makes you move faster in all directions controlled by the WASD keys.
* Shoot three different types of projectiles with the mouse buttons:
  * Left click: Shoots a projectile which creates a Blue field on the surface it hits
  * Right click: Shoots a projectile which creates a Yellow field on the surface it hits
  * Middle click: Shoots a projectile which creates a Green field on the surface it hits
* Create localized fields around you for a short time using buttons Q, E and Shift.
  * Q: Blue field
  * E: Yellow field
  * Shift: Green field
* The goal is to reach the tree at the platform on the other side of the map as quickly as possible. There are two levels.
